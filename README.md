# FlipperMCE - PCB and Case

This repository contains the pcb files and the case for FlipperMCE - a GameCube Memory Card Emulator.

## PCB

Production files (gerbers/bom/cpl) for JLCPCB can be found in the releases section.

When ordering the PCB, make sure to use the following settings:

- 0.8 mm thickness
- ENIG finish

For the "connector" version, a display needs to be ordered separately.
Make sure, the display has a 0.5mm pitch with 30 Pins.
These displays can be found at aliexpress or other market places.


## Case

The case files are located in the ```case``` folder. For normal use, you would print:

- FlipperMCE_Bottom_v1.stl
- FlipperMCE_top_v1.stl
- FlipperMCE_Buttons_v1.stl
- either FlipperMCE_DisplayBracket_v1.stl or FlipperMCE_DisplayBracket_alter_v1.stl

Make sure to follow the assembly guide at (https://flippermce.github.io)[https://flippermce.github.io].
